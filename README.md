# practical-dapr project

A lightweight low ceremony microservices without Docker, Docker-compose and Helm chart files are lifted and shifted the cloud-native apps to Kubernetes platform and run on Dapr runtime.

# Technical Stack

## Infrastructure

- **`Windows 10`** - the OS for developing and building this demo application.
- **[`Windows subsystem Linux - Ubuntu OS`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10)** - the subsystem that helps to run easily the bash shell on Windows OS.
- **[`Docker for desktop (Kubernetes enabled)`](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)** - the easiest tool to run Docker, Docker Swarm and Kubernetes on Mac and Windows.
- **[`Kubernetes`](https://kubernetes.io) / [`AKS`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks)** - the app is designed to run on Kubernetes (both locally on "Docker for Desktop", as well as on the cloud with AKS).
- **[`Dapr`](https://github.com/dapr/dapr)** - Portable, event-driven, runtime for building distributed applications across cloud and edge.
- **[`Tye`](https://github.com/dotnet/tye)** - Tool that makes developing, testing, and deploying microservices and distributed applications easier. Project Tye includes a local orchestrator to make developing microservices easier and the ability to deploy microservices to Kubernetes with minimal configuration.
  
## Back-end

- **[`ASP.NET Core`](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore)** - Cross-platform .NET framework for building modern cloud-based web applications on Windows, Mac, or Linux
- **[`IdentityServer4`](https://github.com/IdentityServer/IdentityServer4)** - OpenID Connect and OAuth 2.0 Framework for ASP.NET Core
- **[`grpc-dotnet`](https://github.com/grpc/grpc-dotnet)** - High-performance, open-source universal RPC framework

# Dapr building blocks

## Service to service

- Dapr client to calling to another service (`product-catalog-api` to `inventory-api`)
- HTTP/gRPC invocation

## State store

- Using state management to store the shopping cart data and its items
- Redis for state management

## Pub/sub message

- Create, update and delete a project at `product-catalog-api`, and subsequently publish an event to `inventory-api` to create `price`, `rop`, and `eoq`
- Redis for pub/sub

## Input/output binding

TODO

## Observability

- Run `tye` command as following

```bash
$ tye run --dtrace zipkin=http://localhost:9411 --logs seq=http://localhost:5340
```

- Log management with Seq dashboard
